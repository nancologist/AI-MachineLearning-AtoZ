# Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science

# 1. Welcome to the course
## 1.3. Why Machin Learning is the future?
* For the Dawn of Time until 2005 the human race have created 130 EXABYTES!
* until 2010 that number was : 1,200 EXABYTES
* until 2015 : 7,900 EXABYTES
* estimated for 2020 : 40,900 EXABYTES

Maching Learning can help to use this huge Data more and better.

Some of the things you will learn in this podcast:
What is Machine Learning
Mastering Data Science through online courses
What are Recommender Systems
Million dollar question: R vs Python (vs Julia)
What Grand project Hadelin and I are currently working on
Plus you will get an overview of:
Regressions
Classifications
Clustering
Association rule learning
Reinforcement learning
Deep learning


See you in class!

Sincerely,

Kirill Eremenko
