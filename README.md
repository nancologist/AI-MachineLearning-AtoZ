# Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science

# 1. Welcome to the course
## 1.3. Why Machin Learning is the future?
* For the Dawn of Time until 2005 the human race have created 130 EXABYTES!
* until 2010 that number was : 1,200 EXABYTES
* until 2015 : 7,900 EXABYTES
* estimated for 2020 : 40,900 EXABYTES

Maching Learning can help to use this huge Data more and better.

## 1.5. Meet your instructors
Hi there,

Hope you are enjoying the course so far!

Not so long ago Hadelin and I did an interview on the SDS Podcast. This is the best place to start if you would like to learn more about his background... and a bit about me too if this is your first course with me :)

Link:

Some of the things you will learn in this podcast:
What is Machine Learning
Mastering Data Science through online courses
What are Recommender Systems
Million dollar question: R vs Python (vs Julia)
What Grand project Hadelin and I are currently working on
Plus you will get an overview of:
Regressions
Classifications
Clustering
Association rule learning
Reinforcement learning
Deep learning


See you in class!

Sincerely,

Kirill Eremenko

# 1. Data Preprocessing
## 1.1. Module Introduction
In each section we first start with Python and then do it with the R.
___

## 1.2. Importing the Libraries
### PYTHON
For Machine Learning in Python we always need at least these three libraries:

* __Numpy__ : To work with arrays and do mathematical operations
* __matplotlib.pyplot__ : Which allows you to create charts
* __pandas__ : which allows you to import dataset and create easily matrices and vectors.

#### Installation
So we should install these libraries which we need into our Virtual Env.:
* ``pip install numpy``
* ``pip install matplotlib``
* ``pip install pandas``
